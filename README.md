## About Cooklang
Cooklang is the markup language at the center of an open-source ecosystem for cooking and recipe management. In Cooklang, each text file is a recipe written as plain-english instructions with markup syntax to add machine-parsible information about required ingredients, cookware, time, and metadata.

## The .cook recipe specification
Below is the specification for defining a recipe in Cooklang.

### Ingredients

To define an ingredient, use the `@` symbol. If the ingredient's name contains multiple words, indicate the end of the name with `{}`.

```
Then add @salt and @ground black pepper{} to taste.
```

To indicate the quantity of an item, place the quantity inside `{}` after the name.

```
Poke holes in @potato{2}.
```

To use a unit of an item, such as weight or volume, add a `%` between the quantity and unit.

```
Place @bacon strips{1%kg} on a baking sheet and glaze with @syrup{1/2%tbsp}.
```

### Steps

Each paragraph in your recipe file is a cooking step. Separate steps with an empty line.

```
A step,
the same step.

A different step.
```

### Comments
You can add comments up to the end of the line to Cooklang text with `--`.
```
-- Don't burn the roux!

Mash @potato{2%kg} until smooth -- alternatively, boil 'em first, then mash 'em, then stick 'em in a stew.
```

Or block comments with `[- comment text -]`.
```
Slowly add @milk{4%cup} [- TODO change units to litres -], keep mixing
```

### Metadata
Recipes are more than just steps and ingredientsâ€”they also include context, such as preparation times, authorship, and dietary relevance. You can add metadata to your recipe using YAML front matter, add `---` at the beginning of a file and `---` at the end of the front matter block.

```yaml
---
title: Spaghetti Carbonara
tags:
  - pasta
  - quick
  - comfort food
---
```

### Cookware
You can define any necessary cookware with `#`. Like ingredients, you don't need to use braces if it's a single word.
```
Place the potatoes into a #pot.
Mash the potatoes with a #potato masher{}.
```

### Timer
You can define a timer using `~`.
```
Lay the potatoes on a #baking sheet{} and place into the #oven{}. Bake for ~{25%minutes}.
```

Timers can have a name too:

```
Boil @eggs{2} for ~eggs{3%minutes}.
```

Applications can use this name in notifications.

## Shopping Lists
To support the creation of shopping lists by apps and the command line tool, Cooklang includes a specification for a configuration file to define how ingredients should be grouped on the final shopping list.
You can use `[]` to define a category name. These names are arbitrary, so you can customize them to meet your needs. For example, each category could be an aisle or section of the store, such as `[produce]` and `[deli]`.
```
[produce]
potatoes

[dairy]
milk
butter
```
Or, you might be going to multiple stores, in which case you might use `[Tesco]` and `[Costco]`.
```
[Costco]
potatoes
milk
butter

[Tesco]
bread
salt
```
You can also define synonyms with `|`.
```
[produce]
potatoes

[dairy]
milk
butter

[deli]
chicken

[canned goods]
tuna|chicken of the sea
```

## Conventions

There're things which aren't part of the language specification but rather common conventions used in tools build on top of the language.

### Adding Pictures
You can add images to your recipe by including a supported image file (`.png`,`.jpg`) matching the name of the recipe recipe in the same directory.
```
Baked Potato.cook
Baked Potato.jpg
```
You can also add images for specific steps by including a step number before the file extension.
```
Chicken French.cook
Chicken French.0.jpg
Chicken French.3.jpg
```

### Canonical metadata

To use your recipes across different apps, follow the conventions on how to name metadata in common cases:

| Key | Purpose | Example value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `source`, `source.name` | Where the recipe came from. Usually a URL, can also be text (eg. a book title). | `https://example.org/recipe`, `The Palomar Cookbook <urn:isbn:9781784720995>`, `mums` |
| `author`, `source.author` | The author of the recipe. | `John Doe` |
| `source.url`|The URL of the recipe if nested format is used.|`https://example.org/recipe`|
| `servings`, `serves`, `yield` | Indicates how many people the recipe is for. Used for scaling quantities. Leading number is used for scaling, anything else is ignored but shown as units. | `2`,`15 cups worth` |
| `course`, `category` | Meal category or course. | `dinner` |
| `locale` | The locale of the recipe. Used for spelling/grammar during edits, and for pluralisation of amounts. Uses ISO 639 language code, then optionally an underscore and the ISO 3166 alpha2 "country code" for dialect variants | `es_VE`, `en_GB`, `fr`  |
| `time required`, `time` or `duration` | The preparation + cook time of the recipe. Various formats can be parsed, if in doubt use `HhMm` format to avoid plurals and locales. | `45 minutes`, `1 hour 30 minutes`,`1h30m` |
| `prep time`, `time.prep`|Time for preparation steps only.|`2 hour 30 min`|
| `cook time`, `time.cook`|Time for actual cooking steps.|`10 minutes`|
| `difficulty`|Recipe difficulty level.|`easy`|
| `cuisine`|The cuisine of the recipe.|`French`|
| `diet`|Indicates a dietary restriction or guideline for which this recipe or menu item is suitable, e.g. diabetic, halal etc.|`gluten-free`, or array of values|
| `tags`|List of descriptive tags.|`[2022, baking, summer]`|
| `image`, `images`, `picture`, `pictures`|URL to a recipe image.|`https://example.org/recipe_image.jpg` or array of URLs|
| `title`|Title of the recipe.|`Uzbek Manti`|
| `introduction`, `description`|Additional notes about the recipe.|`This recipe is a traditional Uzbek dish that is made with a variety of vegetables and meat.`|

## Advanced

### Notes
To include relevant background, insights, or personal anecdotes that aren't part of the cooking steps, use notes. Start a new line with `>` and add your story.

```
> Don't burn the roux!

Mash @potato{2%kg} until smooth -- alternatively, boil 'em first, then mash 'em, then stick 'em in a stew.
```

### Sections
Some recipes are more complex than others and may include components that need to be prepared separately. In such cases, you can use the section syntax, e.g., `==Dough==`. The section name and the `=` symbols after it are optional, and the number of `=` symbols does not matter.

```cooklang
= Dough

Mix @flour{200%g} and @water{100%ml} together until smooth.

== Filling ==

Combine @cheese{100%g} and @spinach{50%g}, then season to taste.
```

### Short-hand preparations

Many recipes involve repetitive ingredient preparations, such as peeling or chopping. To simplify this, you can define these common preparations directly within the ingredient reference using shorthand syntax:

```cooklang
Mix @onion{1}(peeled and finely chopped) and @garlic{2%cloves}(peeled and minced) into paste.
```

These preparations will be clearly displayed in the ingredient list, allowing you to get everything ready before you start cooking.
