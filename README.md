## About Cooklang
Cooklang is the markup language at the center of an open-source ecosystem for cooking and recipe management. In Cooklang, each text file is a recipe written as plain-english instructions with markup syntax to add machine-parsible information about required ingredients, cookware, time, and metadata.

## The .cook recipe specification
Below is the specification for defining a recipe in Cooklang.

### Ingredients

To define an ingredient, use the `@` symbol. If the ingredient's name contains multiple words, indicate the end of the name with `{}`.

```cooklang
Then add @salt and @ground black pepper{} to taste.
```

To indicate the quantity of an item, place the quantity inside `{}` after the name.

```cooklang
Poke holes in @potato{2}.
```

To use a unit of an item, such as weight or volume, add a `%` between the quantity and unit.

```cooklang
Place @bacon strips{1%kg} on a baking sheet and glaze with @syrup{1/2%tbsp}.
```

Now you can try Cooklang and experiment with a few things in the [Cooklang Playground](https://cooklang.github.io/cooklang-rs/)!

### Steps

Each paragraph in your recipe file is a cooking step. Separate steps with an empty line.

```cooklang
A step,
the same step.

A different step.
```

### Comments
You can add comments up to the end of the line to Cooklang text with `--`.
```cooklang
-- Don't burn the roux!

Mash @potato{2%kg} until smooth -- alternatively, boil 'em first, then mash 'em, then stick 'em in a stew.
```

Or block comments with `[- comment text -]`.
```cooklang
Slowly add @milk{4%cup} [- TODO change units to litres -], keep mixing
```

### Metadata
Recipes are more than just steps and ingredientsâ€”they also include context, such as preparation times, authorship, and dietary relevance. You can add metadata to your recipe using YAML front matter, add `---` at the beginning of a file and `---` at the end of the front matter block.

```yaml
---
title: Spaghetti Carbonara
tags:
  - pasta
  - quick
  - comfort food
---
```

### Cookware
You can define any necessary cookware with `#`. Like ingredients, you don't need to use braces if it's a single word.
```cooklang
Place the potatoes into a #pot.
Mash the potatoes with a #potato masher{}.
```

### Timer
You can define a timer using `~`.
```cooklang
Lay the potatoes on a #baking sheet{} and place into the #oven{}. Bake for ~{25%minutes}.
```

Timers can have a name too:

```cooklang
Boil @eggs{2} for ~eggs{3%minutes}.
```

Applications can use this name in notifications.

## Shopping Lists
To support the creation of shopping lists by apps and the command line tool, Cooklang includes a specification for a configuration file to define how ingredients should be grouped on the final shopping list.
You can use `[]` to define a category name. These names are arbitrary, so you can customize them to meet your needs. For example, each category could be an aisle or section of the store, such as `[produce]` and `[deli]`.
```toml
[produce]
potatoes

[dairy]
milk
butter
```
Or, you might be going to multiple stores, in which case you might use `[Tesco]` and `[Costco]`.
```toml
[Costco]
potatoes
milk
butter

[Tesco]
bread
salt
```
You can also define synonyms with `|`.
```toml
[produce]
potatoes

[dairy]
milk
butter

[deli]
chicken

[canned goods]
tuna|chicken of the sea
```

## Conventions

There are things which aren't part of the language specification but rather common conventions used in tools built on top of the language.

### Adding Pictures
You can add images to your recipe by including a supported image file (`.png`,`.jpg`) matching the name of the recipe in the same directory.
```sh
Baked Potato.cook
Baked Potato.jpg
```
You can also add images for specific steps by including a step number before the file extension.
```sh
Chicken French.cook
Chicken French.0.jpg
Chicken French.3.jpg
```

### Canonical metadata

To use your recipes across different apps, follow the conventions on how to name metadata in common cases:

| Key | Purpose | Example value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `source`, `source.name` | Where the recipe came from. Usually a URL, can also be text (eg. a book title). | `https://example.org/recipe`, `The Palomar Cookbook <urn:isbn:9781784720995>`, `mums` |
| `author`, `source.author` | The author of the recipe. | `John Doe` |
| `source.url`|The URL of the recipe if nested format is used.|`https://example.org/recipe`|
| `servings`, `serves`, `yield` | Indicates how many people the recipe is for. Used for scaling quantities. Leading number is used for scaling, anything else is ignored but shown as units. | `2`,`15 cups worth` |
| `course`, `category` | Meal category or course. | `dinner` |
| `locale` | The locale of the recipe. Used for spelling/grammar during edits, and for pluralisation of amounts. Uses ISO 639 language code, then optionally an underscore and the ISO 3166 alpha2 "country code" for dialect variants | `es_VE`, `en_GB`, `fr`  |
| `time required`, `time` or `duration` | The preparation + cook time of the recipe. Various formats can be parsed, if in doubt use `HhMm` format to avoid plurals and locales. | `45 minutes`, `1 hour 30 minutes`,`1h30m` |
| `prep time`, `time.prep`|Time for preparation steps only.|`2 hour 30 min`|
| `cook time`, `time.cook`|Time for actual cooking steps.|`10 minutes`|
| `difficulty`|Recipe difficulty level.|`easy`|
| `cuisine`|The cuisine of the recipe.|`French`|
| `diet`|Indicates a dietary restriction or guideline for which this recipe or menu item is suitable, e.g. diabetic, halal etc.|`gluten-free`, or array of values|
| `tags`|List of descriptive tags.|`[2022, baking, summer]`|
| `image`, `images`, `picture`, `pictures`|URL to a recipe image.|`https://example.org/recipe_image.jpg` or array of URLs|
| `title`|Title of the recipe.|`Uzbek Manti`|
| `introduction`, `description`|Additional notes about the recipe.|`This recipe is a traditional Uzbek dish that is made with a variety of vegetables and meat.`|

## Pantry Configuration

Cooklang supports a pantry inventory file in TOML format to track ingredients you have on hand. This file helps with meal planning and shopping list generation.

### Format

The pantry file uses TOML sections to organize items by storage location:

```toml
[freezer]
cranberries = "500%g"
spinach = { bought = "05.05.2024", expire = "05.06.2025", quantity = "1%kg" }

[fridge]
milk = { expire = "10.05.2024", quantity = "1%L" }

[pantry]
rice = "5%kg"
```

### Supported Attributes

Each item can be specified as either:
- A simple quantity string: `"500%g"`
- An object with attributes:
  - `bought`: Date when the item was purchased (e.g., "05.05.2024")
  - `expire`: Expiration date of the item (e.g., "05.06.2025")
  - `quantity`: Amount using Cooklang quantity format (e.g., "1%kg")
  - `low`: Low stock threshold for alerts (e.g., "100%g")

### Example

```toml
[freezer]
ice_cream = "2%L"
frozen_peas = { bought = "01.01.2024", quantity = "500%g", low = "200%g" }

[fridge]
cheese = { expire = "15.05.2024" }
yogurt = { bought = "05.05.2024", expire = "12.05.2024", quantity = "500%ml" }

[pantry]
flour = "5%kg"
pasta = { quantity = "1%kg", low = "200%g" }
```

Applications can use this data to check ingredient availability, track expiration dates, and generate shopping lists based on what's running low.

## Scaling and Servings

Cooklang supports automatic recipe scaling based on servings. This allows users to adjust recipes for different numbers of people.

### Defining Servings

Specify the default serving size in the metadata:

```yaml
---
servings: 2
---
```

If not specified, recipes default to 1 serving. All ingredient quantities in the recipe are written for this default serving size.

### Scaling Behavior

#### Linear Scaling (Default)
Most ingredients scale linearly with servings:

```cooklang
Add @milk{1/2%cup} and mix until smooth.
```

When scaling from 2 to 4 servings, the milk quantity doubles to 1 cup.

#### Fixed Quantities
Some ingredients shouldn't scale. Use `=` to lock the quantity:

```cooklang
Season with @salt{=1%tsp} to taste.
```

This keeps salt at 1 tsp regardless of serving size.

### What Doesn't Scale

- **Timers**: Cooking times typically remain the same regardless of portion size
- **Cookware**: Pan and pot sizes don't automatically adjust

### Example

```cooklang
---
servings: 4
---

Mix @flour{500%g} with @water{300%ml}.
Add @yeast{=1%packet} and let rise for ~{1%hour}.
```

When scaled to 8 servings:
- Flour becomes 1000g (doubled)
- Water becomes 600ml (doubled)
- Yeast stays at 1 packet (fixed)
- Rising time remains 1 hour (timers don't scale)

## Advanced

### Notes
To include relevant background, insights, or personal anecdotes that aren't part of the cooking steps, use notes. Start a new line with `>` and add your story.

```cooklang
> Don't burn the roux!

Mash @potato{2%kg} until smooth -- alternatively, boil 'em first, then mash 'em, then stick 'em in a stew.
```

### Sections
Some recipes are more complex than others and may include components that need to be prepared separately. In such cases, you can use the section syntax, e.g., `==Dough==`. The section name and the `=` symbols after it are optional, and the number of `=` symbols does not matter.

```cooklang
= Dough

Mix @flour{200%g} and @water{100%ml} together until smooth.

== Filling ==

Combine @cheese{100%g} and @spinach{50%g}, then season to taste.
```

### Short-hand preparations

Many recipes involve repetitive ingredient preparations, such as peeling or chopping. To simplify this, you can define these common preparations directly within the ingredient reference using shorthand syntax:

```cooklang
Mix @onion{1}(peeled and finely chopped) and @garlic{2%cloves}(peeled and minced) into paste.
```

### Referencing other recipes

You can reference other recipes using the existing `@` ingredient syntax, inferring relative file paths from the ingredient name:

```cooklang
Pour over with @./sauces/Hollandaise{150%g}.
```

These preparations should be clearly displayed in the ingredient list, allowing you to get everything ready before you start cooking.
